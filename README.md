# Tyumi

## A Roguelike Engine/Library Thing

Tyumi is a general purpose Roguelike library and game engine. While the primary purpose is for making exciting roguelike games, it can be used to make any program that displays visually on a grid.

Tyumi is the 2nd generation of the engine, with much of it pulled from my previous engine Burl-E. While Burl-E was functional and usable, it was suffering from some longstanding structural issues that were not easy to address. It is my hope that Tyumi will be an evolution on the past, easier to work on and more useful for others who might want to take a dive in.

As an example, much of the functionality of Burl-E has been separated out into self-sufficient packages that can be used as is. The vec and log packages are already mature and usable, and the gfx package is probably robust enough to use to create 2D interfaces. It's my hope that roguelike developers using Go might be able to get some use out of Tyumi -- even if they don't want to use the whole engine -- by grabbing individual portions of it that they find useful.

 I'm still putting it together and ironing out the kinks, so it's probably not the best idea to use it just yet.
